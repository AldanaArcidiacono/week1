# Learning Git

## Git examples:

### git checkout HEAD~main : Moves the HEAD where you choose

### git reset HEAD~2 : Moves the BRANCH to the commit you choose ##### (Move from the head, x commits behind or you can put the name of the commit EJ: git reset 9565cfbdbd917504a631fcbb5e2c906cfe774ca3 )

### We can also find the "futures" commits showing the reflogs (to know the name of the commit) and then, in the terminal with: git reset (name of the commit)
